Jupyter notebooks
**************************
These python notebooks can be found in the main code repository, under *notebooks*, and are fully interactable. We also provide Google collab extensions, which can be found in the introduction to each tutorial. 
They provide a high-level introduction to interfacing with ``optimusprimal``.
